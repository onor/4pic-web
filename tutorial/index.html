        AngularJs, WebJars, Play
    </h2>

    <p>
        This tutorial describes the use of <a href="http://angularjs.org/" target="_blank">AngularJs</a>,
        <a href="http://requirejs.org/" target="_blank">RequireJS</a> and
        <a href="http://www.webjars.org/" target="_blank">WebJars</a> using the
        <a href="http://www.playframework.com/" target="_blank">Play</a> framework.
        An overview will first be provided of each technology. You will then you guided through how to use
        these technologies with Play.
    </p>

    <p>
        This tutorial will take you about 10 minutes. You will be pleasantly surprised with how little there
        is to be done when using Play and AngularJs, or JavaScript in general for that matter!
    </p>

<div>
    <h2>
        AngularJs
    </h2>

    <p>
        AngularJS lets you extend HTML vocabulary for your application. The resulting environment is expressive,
        readable, and quick to develop with. We have based this angular-seed-play project on the
        <a href="https://github.com/angular/angular-seed" target="_blank">angular-seed</a> project which is the
        official starting point when writing new AngularJs applications.
    </p>

    <p>
        An advantage of using Play along with its RequireJs integration is that you will see a reduction in the
        code required when compared with the original angular-seed project. The resulting code should also be
        easier to maintain given the management of library versions.
    </p>
</div>
<div>
    <h2>
        RequireJS
    </h2>

    <p>
        Requirejs is a popular implementation of the
        <a href="https://github.com/amdjs/amdjs-api/wiki/AMD" target="_blank">AMD</a> specification -
        a means by which JavaScript applications can be modularised. The easiest way of thinking about AMD is
        that it is JavaScript's equivalent of package and import statements (or namespace and include
        statements depending on your preferences!).
    </p>
</div>
<div>
    <h2>
        WebJars
    </h2>

    <p>
        WebJars are zip files containing html, css, images, JavaScript and other web resources along with
        a computer-readable description of the library.
    </p>

    <p>
        Managing the versions and dependencies of JavaScript libraries is just as important as for any other
        language. Let's say that your favorite library is required and that it has a dependency on jQuery.
        Ordinarily you would be required to ensure that jQuery is loaded before your library otherwise there
        will be errors. When using your favorite library's WebJar, jQuery is declared as a dependency such that
        it will be loaded automatically.
    </p>

    <p>
        These WebJars are deployed to well known repositories including Maven Central. There are many popular
        JavaScript libraries already available as WebJars and the number is increasing. WebJars utilize familiar
        and established repositories instead of relying on newly introduced ones. Many organisations are already
        using and hosting Maven and Ivy based repositories so it makes sense to leverage them. To further support
        this, over 8 billion downloads occurred on Maven Central in 2012.
    </p>
</div>
<div>
    <h2>
        JavaScript and Play
    </h2>

    <p>
        The first thing to state is that we want to make developing web applications in conjunction with Play
        as familiar as possible when it comes to authoring JavaScript. To use a WebJar the programmer declares
        its dependency in Play's <a href="#code/project/Build.scala" class="shortcut">Build.scala</a> file.
        This file describes a Play project in a similar way that a
        <a href="http://maven.apache.org/pom.html" target="_blank">Maven pom</a> or
        <a href="https://npmjs.org/doc/json.html" target="_blank">NPM's package.json</a> does.
    </p>

    <p>
        What is important to note is that the variable declared <code>appDependencies</code> specifies a list
        of WebJars that are required directly by the project. angularjs, requirejs and the webjars-play plugin
        are declared along with their versions. webjars-play actually depends on requirejs and so the above
        dependency declaration is not strictly required. However it is there to show that whatever requirejs
        version is declared by webjars-play, a different version can override it e.g. webjars-play depends on
        requirejs version 2.1.1 and so when requirejs version 2.2 is released then 2.2 can be specified above.
    </p>

    <p>
        Knowledge of Scala is not required in order to declare dependencies. The above constitutes the total
        amount of Scala that you actually need to deal with. The
        <a href="http://www.webjars.org/" target="_blank">WebJars website</a> allows the easy selection of a
        WebJar and its version and then outputs the declaration required to download it for Play, SBT, Maven,
        Gradle and other build tools.
</div>
<div>
    <h2>
        Routes
    </h2>

    <p>
        The next requirement is to tell Play how WebJar assets are going to be resolved. Play's
        <a href="#code/conf/routes" class="shortcut">routes</a> file is used to do this.
    </p>

    <p>
        The routes declare that Play to return a wrapper of requirejs whenever <code>/lib/require.js</code> is
        requested. This wrapper configures requirejs so that it knows how to resolve files hosted within WebJars.
        The <code>/webjars/*file</code> declaration takes a file path and locates the corresponding resource
        from a WebJar.
    </p>

    <p>
        As a JavaScript programmer, you need do very little else to have Play deliver a JavaScript application.
    </p>
</div>
<div>
    <h2>
        RequireJS Usage
    </h2>

    <p>
        Declaring the use of requirejs should look quite familiar.
        <a href="#code/public/index.html" class="shortcut">index.html</a> includes RequireJS using a
        <code>script</code> tag and a <code>data-main</code> attribute. The <code>data-main</code> attribute
        informs RequireJS of what file to start with once it has been loaded itself.
    </p>

    <p>
        Given the routes declaration from the previous section
        <a href="#code/public/index.html" class="shortcut">index.html</a> will bring in
        <a href="#code/public/js/app.js" class="shortcut">app.js</a> after RequireJS has been loaded. Note
        that Play must also understand the routing in terms of how to load resources from the js path. Check
        out the <a href="#code/conf/routes" class="shortcut">route declaration</a> for <code>/*file</code> -
        this tells a thing called the asset controller to get the file from the public folder.
    </p>

    <p>
        The first few lines of the require statement in
        <a href="#code/public/js/app.js" class="shortcut">app.js</a> declare dependencies on JavaScript files
        relative to the current one via the <code>./</code> convention. These files are required by the
        angular-seed project itself. The line of interest for this topic though is
        <code>"webjars!angular.js"</code>. What this does is call upon the WebJars requirejs plugin to load a
        file that is contained in a WebJar declared as a dependency. An interesting side-effect of this is that
        any dependencies that angular.js has will also be loaded first!
    </p>
</div>
<div>
    <h2>
        More RequireJS Usage
    </h2>

    <p>
        You'll notice a comment, <code>/*global ...</code>. This comment is a
        <a href="http://www.jslint.com/lint.html" target="_blank">JsLint</a> directive declaring what globals
        are assigned from other JavaScript files. Not having this declaration would result in warnings in our
        code. You can see this for yourself by removing the line beginning with <code>/*global</code>.
    </p>

    <p>
        You'll also note that there's a <code>define</code> declaration for AngularJs itself and that the module
        name is "angular". This is not strictly necessary as you can declare dependencies on AngularJs as
        <code>"webjars!angular.js"</code> throughout your code. However we have this <code>define</code>
        declare the module id of <code>"angular"</code> so that the <code>"webjars!"</code> syntax can be
        avoided throughout our code. One benefit of this convention is that the code you write does not depend
        directly on WebJars, just AMD itself. Your code should therefore remain portable. Another benefit, in
        the case of AngularJs, is that a specific locale of it can be assigned to the "angular"
        module id and free you from specifying the locale elsewhere in your project. Hundreds of locales for
        AngularJs are available from its WebJar.
    </p>

    <p>
        Note that you would typically define all aliases to <code>webjars!</code> resources in one place. In
        our case we are using <a href="#code/public/js/app.js" class="shortcut">app.js</a> as it is the main
        file of our project.
    </p>

    <h2>
        Conclusion
    </h2>

    <p>
        This tutorial has taken you through the requirements of a Play application in order to use AngularJs,
        RequireJS and WebJars in the context of the Play framework.
    </p>

    <p>
        We intend to enhance the JavaScript development experience further with the goal of making Play the #1
        choice for web development.
    </p>

    <p>
        Happy Play-ing with AngularJs!
